            <h2>BLOCK AND DEFENCE</h2>
            <p>Blocking and defence rating in Median XL work much the same as in classic Diablo II Lord of Destruction,
                but their role in the game has changed. In the regular game, max block (75% block) through investment
                into dexterity was common, while defence rating was hardly worth it. The two statistics are much more
                balanced in Median XL.</p>
            <div class="descriptionImage"><img src="img/menu/MXL_menu_011.jpg"></div>
            <hr>
            <span class="bold">Defense</span>
            <p>The chance to be hit is as follows:</p>
            <span class="bold">CtBH = 100*(attack)/(attack + defence)</span>
            <p>Investing into defence pays off if you can get around 20-50K defence at level 120, at which point you
                will see a noticeable improvement in your chance to be hit. Some builds can go well over 100K defence.
            </p>
            <span class="italic">Important: in Diablo II, defence is ignored when you run. Use 'R' to switch to walk
                mode to preserve your defence. Walk speed is much improved in Median XL.</span>
            <hr>
            <span class="bold">Block</span>
            <p>In Median XL, your chance to block depends on character class, not your shield: </p>
            <p>Amazon/Assassin/Sorceress: 3%<br>
                Druid: 2%<br>
                Paladin: 1%<br>
                Barbarian/Necromancer: 0%</p>
            <p>This is because block rating is boosted by dexterity as follows:</p>
            <p><span class="bold">CtB = (block_percent * dex)/(clvl * 2)</span></p>
            <p>Also, if you use a class-specific shield, you gain +1% extra block rating.</p>
            <p>Max block is hard to reach; you will need to invest heavily into dexterity. This is a balance measure in
                Median XL to ensure that shields do not outclass two-handed weapons as in classic Diablo II Lord of
                Destruction.</p>
                <span class="italic">Important: in Diablo II, your chance to block is reduced to 1/3 while running.</span>

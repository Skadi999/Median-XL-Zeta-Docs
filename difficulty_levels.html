            <h2>Difficulty Levels in Median XL Zeta</h2>
            <p>Just like regular Diablo II Lord of Destruction, Median XL features three difficulty levels. Killing Baal
                unlocks the next difficulty level for that character.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Hatred</span><br>
                Level Range: 1-55<br>
            </p>
            <p>The first and easiest difficulty level. Regular monsters' AI is not very bright and leech works at 1/4
                effectiveness. There's no resist penalty. However,
                you still need a good amount of resistances, because starting from as soon as Act II, certain monsters
                deal
                heavy spell damage.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Terror</span><br>
                Level Range: 55-90<br>
            </p>
            <p>A significant step up in difficulty. Leech is reduced to 1/100 effectiveness, and there's a 50%
                resistances penalty.
                Monsters are smarter, deal heavier damage and have more hp.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Destruction</span><br>
                Level Range: 90-121<br>
            </p>
            <p>The hardest difficulty level. Leech is reduced to a mere 1/200 effectiveness, and there's a 100% penalty
                to resistances. Monsters are even more aggressive than before,
                and certain areas in the later three acts may prove to be much harder than even some uberquests.
                Monsters' spell damage is extremely high. The standard maximum of 75%
                to all resistances might not be enough, so you'll need to find items with a bonus to maximum resistances. Certain
                monsters might even pierce some of your resistances.<br>
                Make absolutely sure that you're prepared before facing the horrors that reside in the later acts of
                this
                difficulty.
            </p>

            <h6>Sacred uniques and sets and area level 121</h6>
            <p>Sacred unique and set items only drop in level 121 areas. Level 121 areas are the harder uberquests, the
                dwellings of the three prime evils and the Halls of Vaught. A full list of level 121 areas can be found
                below: </p>

                Additionally, bosses in level 118+ areas are also level 121, though the chance of finding a level 121
                unique item this way is very low.
                Cherish the moment when it happens!

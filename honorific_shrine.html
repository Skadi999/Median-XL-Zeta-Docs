            <h2>HONORIFIC AND SHRINE CRAFTED ITEMS</h2>
            <p>These item types are new in Median XL.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Mystic Orbs</span><br>
                You may have found some 'Mystic Orbs' or seen them for sale. Mystic Orbs can be applied to an item in
                the Horadric Cube, adding the Orb's affix along with a +2 level penalty, up to 15 times per Orb type.
            </p>
            <p>The level penalty is applied to the required level of either the base item or the socket fillers,
                whichever is higher. Take into account the runes or jewels you want to socket into the item or you may
                end up with an unusable item!</p>

            <h2>Honorific Items</h2><br>
            Honorific items take the concept of Mystic Orbs one step further. Instead of merely improving an existing
            item, honorific items allow you to create your items from scratch with Mystic Orbs. To create a
            honorific item, use the Cube to turn a magic item into a honorific item. See the cube recipe list for
            more information.</p>

            <p>The resulting honorific item has a green name and no magical affixes, but any Mystic Orb bonuses you
                apply to it are doubled, making them very effective indeed.</p>

            <p><span class="italic">Honorific items get double bonuses from Mystic Orbs.</span><br>
                <span class="italic">Honorific items have max sockets for their item type and tier.</span></p>

            <h2>Shrine Crafted Items</h2><br>
            <p>Starting in late Terror difficulty, you may find 'Portable Shrines', the renmants of the shrines below
                Tristram after the collapse of the labyrinth. These are multipurpose items that allow you to add random
                bonuses to an existing item or create your own. A full list of functions can be found in the cube recipe
                list.</p>

            <p>Items created with shrines have an orange name and a combination of random and preset affixes.</p>

            <p><span class="italic">Crafted items get double bonuses from Mystic Orbs.

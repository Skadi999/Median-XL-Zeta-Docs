      <h2>ZETA CHANGELOG</h2>
      <p>This is the complete list of changes made from Omega 003 to Zeta</p>
      <hr>
      <div class="spacing"></div>

      <h3><b>Quality of Life</b></h3>
      <p>
        - Player inventory and horadric cube size has been massively increased<br>
        - Hirelings now have slots for any item, except for a second ring<br>
        - New Item: <b>Flask of Renewal</b>. It functions exactly the same as an Oil of Renewal, but has 50 charges and
        costs 50 times more.<br>
        - Mass disenchanting and "sigging" added. You may disenchant up to 10 items and sig up to 25 items. You may
        combine set & unique items and mix various item types.<br>
        - Arcane Shards now come in sizes of 1 to 4. You may mix different arcane shards in the cube, up to a maximum
        shard worth of 3 Arcane Crystals each time.<br>
        - Shrine Vessels and Arcane Clusters have been added. Cube any Shrine or Arcane Crystal with an Oil of Craft to
        create a Shrine Vessel or Arcane Cluster, respectively. Shrine Vessels and Arcane Clusters act as a container
        for Shrines and Arcane Crystals. Cube a Vessel with shrines of the same type, or a Cluster with Arcane Crystals
        to increase the stored amount. Cube a Vessel or Cluster by itself to receive the Shrine or Crystal and the
        Vessel or Cluster with 1 less item stored.<br>
      </p>

      <h3><b>Characters</b></h3>
      <p>
        - <br>
      </p>

      <h3><b>Items</b></h3>
      <p>
        <b>Item Renames</b><br>
        Renamed the following items, since their names were silly:<br>
        - Roflchopper -> Tveihandr Danox<br>
        - Axekicker -> Brute's Mansplitter<br>
        - Mr. Clubbo -> Garrett's Blackjack<br>
        - Snotflinger -> Claw Viper Bow<br>
        - Boss Crow -> Crowbane<br>
        - Katar Hero -> Blade of Undeath<br>
        - Mr. Painless -> Black Bow of the Betrayer<br>
        - Weird Sister -> Orb of the Occult<br>
        - PortalKombat -> Wrathraven's Skull<br>
        - Trollface -> Hallow's Visage<br>
        - Kekeke -> Coldworm's Eye<br>
        - 83K Damage Cap -> Beanie Sidhe (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Modder's Block -> Shield of Hakan II (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Gauntlets Khan -> Lamha Na Draoithe (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Greatest Axe -> Elder Law (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Safety Fist -> Baron Sludge's Bonecrushers (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - SuperMonStar -> Linarian's Furs (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - The Square Peg -> The Compensator (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Rime Bomb -> Lacuni Cowl (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Nevermind-> Arkenstone (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Big Bad -> Beast Prince<br>
        - Noob Loop -> Flavie's Ring<br>
        - Self-Referential Secret Unlisted Item -> Seal of the City Watch<br>
        - The Idiot Ball -> Fool's Bane<br>
        - Test Tube -> Frozen Quills<br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Item Reworks</b><br>
        - Replaced Tldr Sacred Belt with Vampire's Bloodied Belt. Check the docs for stats.<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>New Items</b><br>
        - Black Hand Sigil
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3><b>Monsters</b></h3>
      - New monster: <span class="rare">Treewarden</span>. Tough tree beasts with a strong Wildfire attack, they spawn
      in some jungle areas of Act III.<br>
      </p>

      <h3><b>Uberquests</b></h3>
      - Added a new item: <span class="unique">Elemental Prism</span>. This is a charm that drops from the Volcanic Shrine in Tran Athulua and is
      used for LC1.<br>
      LC1 now works slightly differently: you must first obtain the Elemental Prism, then head to the bosses, and when
      they drop their charms, cube it with the Elemental Prism. The Prism would then get their bonuses. The charms by
      themselves no longer have any stats on them, so their only use is cubing with the Prism.<br>
      The reason for this feature is that it didn't make sense to cube the charms with scrolls of TP/identify, it felt
      unimmersive. Besides that, it saves you 2 inventory slots.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3><b>Technical</b></h3>
      - Some .txt files, including, but not limited to: uniqueitems.txt, misc.txt, cubemain.txt, sets.txt, armor.txt,
      weapons.txt have been greatly cleaned up and reorganized.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3><b>Code Edits</b></h3>
      - Median XL Zeta now comes with a .dll that provides code edits to the game. The code edits are:
      - The maximum HP that a player can reach before visual bugs occur has been doubled. Credits to whist.
      - Throwing a weapon now no longer reduces its quantity. This was done for 2 reasons:<br>
      a. Throwing weapons had a problem with their price. They would sell for a lot of gold if you put a rune into them
      and their repair cost was high, all because of the quantity.<br>
      b. You cannot repair ethereal items, so if you'd deplete the quantity of an ethereal throwing weapon, it would be
      forever useless. Jewels with the Indestructible attribute don't help with it. Only auto attack would consume
      charges, but accidents can happen and a player might find himself accidentally using auto attack for different
      reasons. The chance of actually depleting a throwing weapons were extremely low, but it's better to be 100%
      safe.<br>
      - The bug with multiple Astroghas spawning should no longer happen (untested)<br>

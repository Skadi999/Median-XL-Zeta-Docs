      <h2>ZETA CHANGELOG</h2>
      <p>This is the complete list of changes made from Omega 003 to Zeta</p>
      <div class="spacing"></div>

      <h3><b>Quality of Life</b></h3>
      <p>
        - Player inventory and horadric cube size has been massively increased<br>
        - Hirelings now have slots for any item, except for a second ring<br>
        - New Item: <b>Flask of Renewal</b>. It functions exactly the same as an Oil of Renewal, but has 50 charges and
        costs 50 times more.<br>
        - Mass disenchanting and "sigging" added. You may disenchant up to 10 items and sig up to 25 items. You may
        combine set & unique items and mix various item types.<br>
        - Arcane Shards now come in sizes of 1 to 4. You may mix different arcane shards in the cube, up to a maximum
        shard worth of 3 Arcane Crystals each time.<br>
        - Shrine Vessels and Arcane Clusters have been added. Cube any Shrine or Arcane Crystal with an Oil of Craft to
        create a Shrine Vessel or Arcane Cluster, respectively. Shrine Vessels and Arcane Clusters act as a container
        for Shrines and Arcane Crystals. Cube a Vessel with shrines of the same type, or a Cluster with Arcane Crystals
        to increase the stored amount. Cube a Vessel or Cluster by itself to receive the Shrine or Crystal and the
        Vessel or Cluster with 1 less item stored.<br>
        - The Scroll of Resistances given by Malah can no longer be used. You must now combine it with the Elemental
        Prism, which will give the resistance bonus to it. This is done to prevent the "malah scroll bug" where the
        resistance bonus disappears after you die, until you relog.<br>
      </p>

      <h3><b>Items</b></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Low-level Gems Rework</b><br>
        Chipped, Flawed and Normal gems have received a complete overhaul. Their stats are now much more useful for low
        level characters and are more similar to the way they were in cLoD. Flawless and Perfect gems remain the
        same.<br>
        Additionally, all gems have received a price overhaul and now sell for more gold.<br>
        See the <a href="../items/gems_runes.html">Gems and Runes</a> page for more details.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Item Renames</b><br>
        Renamed the following items, since their names were silly:<br>
        - Roflchopper -> Tveihandr Danox<br>
        - Axekicker -> Brute's Mansplitter<br>
        - Mr. Clubbo -> Garrett's Blackjack<br>

        - Mr. Painless -> Black Bow of the Betrayer<br>
        - Weird Sister -> Orb of the Occult<br>
        - PortalKombat -> Wrathraven's Skull<br>
        - Trollface -> Hallow's Visage<br>
        - Kekeke -> Coldworm's Eye<br>
        - 83K Damage Cap -> Beanie Sidhe (carried over from 2012)<br>

        - Gauntlets Khan -> Lamha Na Draoithe (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Greatest Axe -> Elder Law (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Safety Fist -> Baron Sludge's Bonecrushers (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - SuperMonStar -> Linarian's Furs (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - The Square Peg -> The Compensator (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Rime Bomb -> Lacuni Cowl (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Nevermind-> Arkenstone (carried over from 2012)<br>
        - Big Bad -> Beast Prince<br>
        - Noob Loop -> Flavie's Ring<br>
        - Self-Referential Secret Unlisted Item -> Seal of the City Watch<br>
        - The Idiot Ball -> Fool's Bane<br>
        - Test Tube -> Frozen Quills<br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Item Reworks</b><br>
        - Replaced Tldr Sacred Belt with Vampire's Bloodied Belt. Check the docs for stats.<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>New Items</b><br>
        - Black Hand Sigil<br>
        - Elixir of Wealth and Greater Elixir of Wealth: these elixirs increase your gold find by 250% and 400%
        respectively.<br>
        - Oil of Transmutation: These are used for some crafting recipes. You can buy them like any other oil, they cost
        15000 gold.<br>
        - Flask of Renewal: See the Quality of Life section.<br>
        - Shrine Vessel and Arcane Cluster: See the Quality of Life section.<br>
        - Enabled the Testament of the Apes set and all of the realm-only uniques from Ω003<br>
        - Oil of Duplication now costs 300,000 gold.<br>

      </p>

      <p><b>Sprites</b>
        - The sprites of many items have been changed. Most of the changes were done for unique items, charms, shrines,
        trophies, Unique Mystic Orbs, and a few misc items like Apples.
      </p>

      <p><b>Gemwords</b>
        - Gemwords have been removed
      </p>


      <h3><b>Crafting</b></h3><br>

      <p><b>Changed Recipes:</b><br>
        <b>Alchemy</b><br>
        - All Alchemy recipes now use an Oil of Transmutation instead of ID/TP scrolls.<br><br>

        - The Dupe Recipe is now only available for magic, rare and crafted jewels and requires 1500 crafting points.
      </p>

      <p><b>New Recipes:</b><br>
        - Greater Elixir of Transmutation: Perfect Diamond + Oil of Transmutation (500 Crafting Points)<br>
        - Arcane Cluster creation: Arcane Crystal + Oil of Transmutation<br>
        - Arcane Cluster increment: Arcane Cluster + Arcane Crystal<br>
        - Arcane Cluster decrement (at 0 charges gives you back the Oil of Transmutation along with the crystal): Arcane
        Cluster<br>
        - Shrine Vessel creation: Shrine + Oil of Transmutation<br>
        - Shrine Vessel increment: Shrine Vessel + 1-10 Shrines of same type<br>
        - Shrine Vessel decrement (at 0 charges gives you back the Oil of Transmutation along with the shrine): Shrine
        Vessel<br>
      </p>

      <p><b>Crafting Point Rework</b><br>
        The crafting points requirement has been increased for some recipes. Namely, the dupe recipe now requires 1500
        crafting points. More changes to the crafting points requirements will be done in the future.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3><b>Monsters</b></h3>
      - New monster: <span class="rare">Treewarden</span>. Tough tree beasts with a strong Wildfire attack, they spawn
      in some jungle areas of Act III.<br>
      </p>

      <h3><b>Uberquests</b></h3>
      - Added a new item: <span class="unique">Elemental Prism</span>. This is a charm that drops from the Volcanic
      Shrine in Tran Athulua and is
      used for LC1.<br>
      LC1 now works slightly differently: you must first obtain the Elemental Prism, then head to the bosses, and when
      they drop their charms, cube it with the Elemental Prism. The Prism would then get their bonuses. The charms by
      themselves no longer have any stats on them, so their only use is cubing with the Prism.<br>
      The reason for this feature is that it didn't make sense to cube the charms with scrolls of TP/identify, it felt
      unimmersive. Besides that, it saves you 2 inventory slots.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3><b>Technical</b></h3>
      - Some .txt files, including, but not limited to: uniqueitems.txt, misc.txt, cubemain.txt, sets.txt, armor.txt,
      weapons.txt have been greatly cleaned up and reorganized.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3><b>Code Edits</b></h3>
      Median XL Zeta now comes with a .dll that provides a couple of code edits to the game:<br><br>
      1. The maximum HP that a player can reach before visual bugs occur has been doubled. Credits to whist.<br>
      2. Throwing a weapon now no longer reduces its quantity and their quantity is now always 1. This was done for 2
      reasons:<br>
      a. Throwing weapons had a problem with their price. They would sell for a lot of gold if you put a rune into them
      and their repair cost was high, all because of the quantity.<br>
      b. You cannot repair ethereal items, so if you'd deplete the quantity of an ethereal throwing weapon, it would be
      forever useless. Jewels with the Indestructible attribute don't help with it. Only auto attack would consume
      charges, but accidents can happen and a player might find himself accidentally using auto attack for different
      reasons. The chance of actually depleting a throwing weapons were extremely low, but it's better to be 100%
      safe.<br>
      3. The bug with multiple Astroghas spawning should no longer happen (untested)<br>

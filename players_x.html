            <h2>The /players X Command</h2>
            <p>This is a classic Lord of Destruction feature that is not known to all players.</p>
            <p>During a single player game or tcp/ip or open battle.net multiplayer game, press Enter and type the
                following:</p>
            <p><span class="bold">/players X</span></p>
            <p>where X is a number from 1 to 8. Press Enter again. The game will confirm your action.</p>
            <div class="descriptionImage"><img src="img/menu/MXL_menu_012.jpg"></div>
            <hr>
            <p>The /players x command makes monsters more difficult but also increases their rewards.
                The command simulates the effect of a real (unpartied) player joining your multiplayer game.
                It greatly boosts monster HP, slightly boosts monster damage and attack rating, but also increases the
                experience you get from the monsters, and reduces the monsters' NoDrop chance (the chance of absolutely
                nothing being dropped from a monster).
            </p>

            <h3>Formulae for the stats affected by the /players x command</h3><br>
            <span class="bold">Monsters' Hit Points and Experience gain:</span><br><br>
            <span class="bold">Hit Points = X * (n + 1) / 2</span><br>
            Where X = base hit points and n = the player number set by the /players x command.

            <span class="bold">Monsters' Damage and Attack Rating</span><br><br>
            <p>Each additional player in the game also increases the damage dealt by 6.25%. This bonus is applied after
                the champion or unique bonus and is further amplified by critical strike. The bonus is the same for both
                ranged and melee attacks, but not every monster skill in the game is increased. This bonus does not
                apply to classic Diablo 2. </p>

            <span class="bold">Drops</span><br><br>
            <p>The /players x command reduces NoDrop according to the following formula:</p>
            <p><span class="bold">NewNoDrop=int( ProbSum/(1/((NoDrop/(NoDrop+ProbSum))^N)-1) )</span></p>
            <p>where N=int(1+AdditionalPlayers/2+ClosePartiedPlayers/2),<br>
                AdditionalPlayers — the number of all additional players in the game, where the monster is killed,<br>
                ClosePartiedPlayers — the number of players in your party near you (not far than two screens away),<br>
                ProbSum=Prob1+Prob2+Prob3+...+Prob10,<br>
                int — operation of truncating fractional part of a number.</p>
            <p>This looks pretty complicated, so for the sake of comprehensibility let's just say:<br>
                <span class="bold">• For normal monsters:</span> The more players, the more drops.<br>
                <span class="bold">• For Super Uniques</span> (like Pindleskin), <span class="bold">Uniques and
                    Champions:</span> player setting is irrelevant.<br>
                • Super Uniques will always drop two items.<br>
                • Uniques will always drop one item.<br>
                • Champions will always drop one item.<br>
                <span class="bold">• Bosses:</span> "nodrop" will be reduced to zero for 5 unpartied players or 3 near
                players in the same party. In
                Single Player the difference between the drops for 3 player setting and 5 player setting is only
                marginal though.<br>

                Note: The formula implies, that for unpartied players (and simulated players via the Players X Command)
                only every second additional players has impact on drop rates. So the steps for more drops are players
                <span class="bold">3, players 5</span> and <span class="bold">players 7.</span><br>
                In other words: players 8 and players 7 have the same drop rates, players 6 and 5, players 4 and 3, and
                players 2 and 1. Note that the amount of Experience gained and monsters' Hit Points are nonetheless
                different for each player setting (as stated above).</p>

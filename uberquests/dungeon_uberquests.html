          <b>Location</b><br>
          Ancient Tunnels (Lost City)
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          'This is a forbidden place. Return whence you came and your life will be spared'
          This first uberquest reenacts a removed quest from Diablo 1. Horazon (also known as the real Summoner)
          summoned a powerful demonlord that turned out to be too strong for him. He managed to trap it in his arcane
          sanctuary, but could not defeat it and it almost killed him. Neither Horazon nor the demon wants you to be
          there, so do not expect a warm welcome by either side...
        </p>
        <p><i>Horazon's holographic transmission is just for flavour and does nothing.</i></p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Kill the Horazon's Familiar, followed by the Creature of Flame. Make sure your lightning resistance is maxed
          because both bosses have Forked Lightning, which does massive amounts of damage at close range.
          You should also get lots of poison resistance to protect yourself against the army of succubi in the area.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>

          The Pit Level 2 (Tamoe Highland)
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          Who knew the fallen clans were technologically adept? This rickety contraption contains wooden clockwork
          mechanisms and the necessary runes to open a gateway to any location in the Burning Hells. This enables it to
          summon hellish creatures at a rapid rate. Move quickly, because time is against you.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The tower periodically summons a selection of dangerous elite monsters. Try to reach and destroy it as quickly
          as possible, but keep in mind that after attacking it, it will become immune for a short while before you're
          able to attack it again. Know your character's weaknesses against the various types of elites and try to
          eliminate the dangerous ones quickly!

          <b>Location</b><br>
          Swampy Pit Level 3 (Flayer Jungle)
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          The Swampy Pit serves as testing grounds for Mephisto's latest siege weapon. The Death Projector slowly
          rotates, firing a devastating energy beam in a full circle, annihilating anything in its path.<br><br>

          The weapon is guarded by eight ghostly Mechanics. It is said that they abduct people from the tribes around
          Kurast to sacrifice them, powering the Death Projector’s energy array with their still beating hearts. The
          Mechanics are immune to any attack and if they kill a player or minion in the central circle, the Death
          Projector is restored to its original condition.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The siege tower is tended to by trained Zakarumite techpriests. Its magitech shield is impenetrable to all
          weapons, but when it senses a Mechanic nearby, it lowers its shield to enable maintenance. In this state, the
          Death Projector can be damaged, though its fortified outer shell still harmlessly deflects a percentage of all
          incoming attacks. The Mechanics themselves carry portable gap generators and are impossible to hit or kill.
          Damage the Death Projector while avoiding Mechanics until the devilish device finally falls.
        </p>

          Defeat the Death Projector on Destruction difficulty to get the <span class="unique">Laser Focus

          Forgotten Reliquary (Upper Kurast)
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          The Lord of Sin walks the earth. In his weakened state, he hides in the catacombs of Kurast, feasting on the
          dark rituals of Mephisto's chosen. Destroy him before he becomes a threat.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Azmodan is accompanied by a legion of elites and emits a black magic aura that grants unholy invulnerability
          to nearby demons and 50% all resistances to himself. The tight confines of the temple area make it hard to get
          past the immortal monsters blocking your way and reach Azmodan himself. He should be easy to kill in his
          weakened state, but beware his powerful Pentagram attack which may require maximum fire resistance to survive.
          Azmodan also feasts on death, healing himself when he makes a kill.

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          <i>'My blade sings for mortal blood, and by my dark masters, it shall not be denied!'</i><br><br>

          Back in the days when Kurast was the centre of civilisation and black magic was not yet frowned upon, this was
          where the priests of Rathma - the necromancers - practiced their art. The place was abandoned when the
          religion of Zakarum took over the city and banned pagan magic, making it the perfect hiding place for an
          ancient evil bent on taking out the Church from within.<br><br>
          Primus, son of Mephisto, was the leader of the Cult of the Triune in ages past before its destruction. His
          efforts to rebuild the Triune were shut down by the crusaders of Zakarum, but he remains a formidable foe,
          doubly so in the home city of the Zakarum.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Primus himself is not particularly hard, despite his powerful ranged Bladestorm attack. The blades track your
          position, but do less damage than his normal attack and can be avoided, blocked and dodged.<br><br>

          Primus is guarded by an army of Gore Crawlers, which after several millennia in and around Rathma Square can
          raise themselves from the dead. Shattering the corpse does not stop this, but the resurrection takes 10
          seconds, during which you can attempt to run away and ditch them.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          Defeat Primus on Destruction difficulty to get the <span class="unique">Spirit Trance Herb.</span> <b>(1/6

          <i>How much suffering, mortal, does it take before you lose your grace?'</i><br><br>

          According to pagan myth, the mortal plane – Sanctuary – was created by the fallen angel Inarius and the demon
          Lilith to serve as a refuge from the Eternal War. The two created a race of servants from the earth which were
          to worship them for all eternity.<br><br>

          Humanity broke free when a small group of farmers rediscovered their birthright and ancient powers inherited
          from their supernatural parents. As the edyrem army grew, Inarius descended into megalomanic madness and was
          eventually destroyed along with his golden cathedral of vanity.<br><br>

          It is whispered that the ghosts of Inarius and his closest worshippers still roam the cathedral…

          The Crystal Ball is the last of the cathedral’s magical defences. The tower exudes a holy invulnerability
          shield to protect nearby revelers and casts a searing beam of angelic lightning that destroys anything it
          touches. Destroy the Crystal Ball to dispel the immortality from the other enemies.<br><br>

          <b>Bug:</b> Because the Crystal Ball has random modifiers, they might sometimes bug and cause it to become
          unkillable. Try teleporting to town and back and hit it again, if it's still unkillable, the only thing you
          can do is relog.

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          Now nothing more than overgrown ruins, Toraja once stood proud as a medium-sized city in ancient times, and
          has become legendary as the city where the nephalem Uldyssian recruited most of his edyrem to spearhead the
          uprising against the infernal Cult of the Triune and Inarius’ Cathedral of Light.<br><br>

          This is where the time portal leads you. Aid the edyrem in their battle against Lilith and the Triune’s
          minions.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The enemies on this level, Celebrant archers and Morlu fighters, are completely invulnerable and there is
          nothing you can do about it. However, if you complete the Judgement Day summoning uberquest, you receive a
          charm that grants the ability to summon edyrem.<br><br>

          The edyrem are fighter-mages who have the ability to dispel the immortality wards off the enemies. Although
          they are vulnerable to the supernatural onslaught of the Triune, they have the power to cast an
          invulnerability shield of their own, allowing them to close in and remove the immunities.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          On Destruction difficulty, when you kill Lilith, you have 30 seconds to cube the Crystalline Flame Medaillon
          you used to summon the edyrem with an Arcane Crystal.<br><br>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          Vizjun, the technological home city of the Viz-Jaq'Taar or Assassins, recently ran into a major system flaw.
          The artificial intelligence, Master Control System seems to have developed sentience as Diablo approached; the
          computer then constructed a large army of robots to take over the city, its missile silos and from there the
          world.</p>

        <p class="uberDesc">The MCS managed to turn the city's cybernetic defences against its inhabitants. Those
          seeking to retake the
          compound will have to contend with its arsenal of combat drones, minefields and electro-pulse generators. It
          is said that the MCS slumbered and fulfilled its menial tasks for years until the Viz-Jaq'Taari scientists
          developed 'The Bomb', a secret weapon capable of destroying entire nations...
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Basic strategy is not too difficult: there are melee robots, laser robots and machine-bolter robots. You
          should know what to do by now.<br><br>

          But beware, Big Brother is watching you. The area's automatic defences will periodically deploy additional
          drones, chaingun sentries, minefields and various explosives when you enter the protected zone. The computer
          voice warns you of what is about to happen.<br><br>

          The level boss, MCS is invulnerable to any damage. To destroy it, use the handy Purify skill you acquired in
          Duncraig. One shot should be enough. Unless you miss.

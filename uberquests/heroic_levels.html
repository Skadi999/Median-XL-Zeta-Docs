      <h2>HEROIC LEVELS</h2>
      <p>Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. Similar to ordinary demons but much stronger and more intelligent, heroic
        demons are more than a match for the toughest heroes.</p>
      <img src="../img/highlights/heroic.gif" alt="Heroic Level">
      <p>Median XL features four heroic areas:</p>
      <p><b>Act 1 Mausoleum (Burial Grounds)<br>
          Act 2 Stony Tomb Level 1 (Rocky Waste)<br>
          Act 5 Icy Cellar (Ancients' Way)</b><br>
        <i>Each of the three areas contains the same 20 heroic monster types. You may want to choose the
          area that suits your character build the most.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Act 1 Cow Level (Rogue Encampment)</b><br>
        <i>Meet invisible cow ninjas, bovine summoners and other figments of your fever dreams after a bad case of food
          poisoning in the Cow Level!</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>All four heroic areas are level 121 on destruction and can drop sacred sets and uniques.</b></p>
      <hr>

      <h2>HEROIC BOSSES</h2>
      <p>Each heroic area is protected by its own guardian. The area's heroic boss may randomly appear in the area, or
        he may not... Beware, heroic bosses are among the hardest encounters in Median XL.<br><br>

        <b>Chaos Shields</b><br>
        All heroic bosses are protected by an invulnerability shield. This shield is nearly impossible to break with
        mortal magic but will occasionally fail and drop a random immunity, though this still leaves the boss with high
        resistance to this element. Use these rare opportunities well.<br><br>
        More precisely, heroic shields periodically give a random increase of resistances to each element at a time.
        Usually, they give more than a 100% resistances, which is why the boss only rarely drops the immunity of a
        particular element. In order to efficiently slay a heroic boss, one should get -199% reduction in resistances
        for the element the character is using (for example, -199% fire pierce for a fire sorceress). The reason for
        that is that then, whether the heroic boss gets a 1% increase or a 99% increase, you will always pierce his
        resistances down to -100% (which is the limit) and deal double damage to the boss. Skills that reduce
        resistances, such as Mythal, further help since they will make the boss receive an increase of less than 100%
        resists much quicker.
      </p>

        </div>
        <p><b>Level</b><br>
          <i>Hatred : 40</i><br>

          <b>Location</b><br>
          Act 1 Cow Level
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          The moolicious heir to the Cow King's throne, Bull Prince Rodeo is out to exact his indiscriminate revenge for
          all the cattle killed by humans.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Bull Prince Rodeo may randomly appear in the Cow Level. Killing Rodeo does not prevent you from entering the
          Cow Level again.<br><br>

          Rodeo is very aggressive and has a stunning teleport spell, making it difficult to put some distance between
          you and him. He summons Cow Soldiers and can call upon a Stampeding Herd that ploughs across the screen,
          trampling all in their path. This ability is unblockable, unresistable and will destroy you if you don't get
          out of the way in time.<br><br>

          His most common spell, in cooperation with another victim of cruel farming practices, is a wave of chickens
          that will pursue their victim relentlessly, inflicting devastating hurt with their beaks if they connect. The
          chickens can be dodged by staying mobile.<br><br>

          Additionally, Bull Prince Rodeo has a hoof stomp spell that knocks back and stuns his enemies in all
          directions.. Try not to stand between Rodeo and a wall or you will become closely acquainted with said wall,
          leaving you unable to dodge his spells and the growing herd of Cow Soldiers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Chaos Shield</b><br>
          Rodeo is a sacred cow, invulnerable to damage. Warding shields are not an exact science, however, and the
          spell may occasionally fail, allowing you to hit him with one or more elements until the spell is restored.
        </p>

          Act 2 Stony Tomb Level 1
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          Hungry for power and misled by Diablo, the Vizjerei mage Quov Tsin almost succeeded in sacrificing the city of
          Ureh to the forces of Hell. He was defeated at the last moment, but his spirit still roams the burial tombs
          looking for a mortal vessel to come back to life...
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Quov Tsin may randomly appear in the Stony Tomb Level 1.<br><br>

          As a former Vizjerei in life, Quov Tsin wields the elements. His most devastating attack is a streaming blast
          of fire, cold and lightning bolts powerful enough to annihilate any hero in a moment. In melee combat, he may
          use a fire, cold and lightning nova combo that causes massive destruction at close range. Prepare for this
          battle by equipping resistance items to counter his ability to pierce resistances, and try to find some absorb
          items to further cut the damage.<br><br>

          Quov Tsin pierces 250% of all elemental resistances. To protect yourself from his magic, you would need 250% +
          100% (destruction difficulty malus) + 95% to all elemental resistances, and 25% to all maximum elemental
          resistances. Additionally, he deals some physical damage. To protect yourself against the physical portion of
          damage, you should get at least 100 flat damage reduction and as much % damage reduction (up to 50%) as you
          can.<br><br>

          His contingency spells protect him by teleporting him to safety when struck by any attack. Stay near cover in
          case he appears too close for comfort.
        </p>
        <p><b>Chaos Shield</b><br>
          Like Rodeo, Quov Tsin is invulnerable most of the time, but occasionally his warding spell may partially fail,
          so seize the opportunity when you see it!<br><br>

          <b>Quov Tsin will never drop his poison immunity.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          Defeat Quov Tsin on Destruction difficulty to get the <span class="unique">Silver Seal of Ureh</span>

          Act 5 Icy Cellar (Ancients' Way)
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          After his defeat in the civil war in Hell, the Lord of Lies and infernal King of Rats was banished to
          Sanctuary where he plots his return. The icy caves under Harrogath offered him both proximity to the powerful
          Worldstone and a dark moist breeding ground for his rodent servants.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Belial may randomly appear in the Icy Cellar.

          As the Lord of Lies, Belial prefers to cheat in battle. His main offence consists of his Henchmen who use the
          Punisher spell to poison heroes to death. If one gets through this line of defence, his tiny rat familiars go
          on the attack. Being so small and fast, they cannot be hit or even aimed at.

          Belial himself knows a spell that spits out punishers in random directions, as well as an area effect spell
          that slowly siphons the victim's life away and a spell that causes more rats to burst from the ground and
          swarm the unwary hero. According to witnesses, Belial does attack recklessly from time to time, chasing his
          enemy around by teleportation, but demonologists believe that this is just to impress his underlings and his
          main intention is to get close to summon another batch of Henchmen.
        </p>
        <p><b>Chaos Shield</b><br>
          Belial is protected by a warding spell that makes him invulnerable to all attacks. Occasionally he may drop
          this shield for a few moments to entice a foolish hero to attack him; this is usually met with a fierce
          counterattack, but it is the only way to kill him.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          Defeat Belial on Destruction difficulty to get the <span class="unique">Book of Lies</span> (1/202,500 chance

          Act 1 Mausoleum
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          One of Hell's greatest, the scheming spider demon Astrogha has surfaced after the fall of Andariel to continue
          his reign of terror. He is not the most powerful demon in close combat, but the arachnid king is never alone.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Astrogha may randomly appear in the Mausoleum.<br><br>

          The spider king does not usually fight his foes directly, but he does not need to. His summoned Spider Statues
          serve as gateways for his personal swarm, belching waves of crawling Darklings from the depths of the void.
          Deal with them quickly, but do not touch the statues! They are protected by one of Astrogha's devious tricks:
          when destroyed, they will both rejuvenate Astrogha and unleash a curse that cripples the assailant causing a
          swift death. If left alone, they will eventually collapse on their own.<br><br>

          Astrogha also possesses a very powerful but close ranged Frozen Orb attack and has contingency spells that
          teleport him away when threatened, courtesy of Quov Tsin's mages.<br><br>

          Astrogha pierces 250% of all your elemental resistances.
        </p>
        <p><b>Chaos Shield</b><br>
          After centuries of fighting side by side at the head of their respective legions, Astrogha employs many of the
          same tactics as Quov Tsin, notably the warding spell that renders Astrogha immune to all attacks. This is
          cutting edge magic and therefore still fails from time to time, allowing you to get some hits in.<br><br>

          <b>Astrogha will never drop his poison immunity.</b>

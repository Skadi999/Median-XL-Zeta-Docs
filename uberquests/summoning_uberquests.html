      <h2>Summoning Uberquests</h2>
      <p>For a hunter like you, the demons infesting Sanctuary may seem easy to destroy. If you want to test your skill
        against the mighty beings of ancient times, cast a summoning spell to pull them back from the dead.</p>

      <p>As any sorcerer knows, in order to summon a creature you need a Book of Summoning. Create one by cubing three
        Sacrifical Hearts and three Meditation Candles.
      </p>
      <p class="reagent">Meditation Candle x3 + Sacrifical Heart x3 -> Book of Summoning</p>
      <p>The Book grants you a new skill called Dark Summoning. Select the skill and cast the skill in the right area to
        summon the boss.</p>

          The Hole Level 2 (Black Marsh)
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          Slain in his hellhole beneath Tristram, the Butcher rises from the dead at the call of your summoning spell
          and the smell of fresh blood. It is said the Butcher cannot be summoned without an acceptable human sacrifice,
          and if none is provided, he will take one...
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The Butcher is slow, but hits very hard and has a high attack rating. Additionally, due to his layers of
          bouncy fat he has a high chance to negate any incoming attack. The basic strategy is simple - do not get hit.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>

          <b>Summon at</b><br>
          Valley of Snakes
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          Reenact the capture and imprisonment of Baal by Tal Rasha and his Horadrim, with you playing the role of Baal.
          To protect their leader, the Horadrim weave warding spells that make Tal Rasha immortal until the last of his
          soldiers has died and their spirits have faded.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          During this uberquest, you morph into Baal when you are near Tal Rasha. The archmage himself is immune to all
          damage until you get rid of his escort by parking them or separating Tal Rasha from his allies. If you have a
          way to break immunities, it may prove to be useful as well</p>

        <p>Being Baal gives you some protection against the attacks of the Horadrim, but these are some of the most
          powerful mages of Sanctuary and can concentrate their fire to bring down even a Prime Evil.</p>

        <p>You may want to stack your resistances, because the Horadrim possess the ability to reduce your effective
          resistances, making you that much weaker.<br>
          Tal Rasha pierces <b>250%</b> of your resistances, while his followers pierce <b>150%</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          Defeat Tal Rasha on Destruction difficulty to get the <span class="unique">Scroll of Kings.</span> (1/25

          <b>Summon at</b><br>
          Arreat Summit
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          In ages past, Diablo himself attempted to invade Mount Arreat to corrupt or destroy the Worldstone and was
          repelled by the Bear tribe defenders. This is a recreation of that battle on the peak of Mount Arreat, with
          you as Diablo.<br><br>

          The shamanic powers of the Bear tribe protect their king with an ancient spirit shield until the last of
          the defenders has fallen.</p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Much like the Tal Rasha encounter, the key target to take out, Shaman King Koth is immune to all damage until
          you kill all of his minions. The difference is that this fight is mainly physical and you need to focus on
          defense and life to survive. Try to break the shield with a resistance piercing spell if you have one.<br><br>

          Beware the piercing Bear Claws which stun you at range. If you let a pack of Bear Shamans catch you, you may
          get locked in perpetual stun until you die.<br><br>

          Thanks to their connection to the primal forces, all shamans have an innate 50% resistance to all.

        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          Defeat King Koth on Destruction difficulty to get the <span class="unique">Sacred Worldstone Key.</span>

          <b>Summon at</b><br>
          Kurast Causeway
        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          This uberquest involves summoning and defeating the ghost of the prophet Akarat and his band of Followers. The
          spirit is ritually summoned in the fortress city of Travincal by the church fathers four times a year or
          during times of trouble. Because Travincal is irrepairably tainted by Mephisto, it may be a better plan to
          summon him at the bridge to Travincal, just outside the walls.<br><br>

          Although Sanctuary owes many years of relative peace to the founder of the Church of Zakarum, both the motives
          of the Church and the plans of the archangels behind it are dubious. Sanctuary would be better off without
          interference from both the Burning Hells and the High Heavens.<br><br>

          If you have problems defeating Akarat, remember that a religion is nothing without followers, and the death of
          his apostles may be a particularly hard blow to Akarat’s spirit.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          As an emissary from the Heavens, the prophet Akarat is immune to all damage. However, when you kill one of his
          Followers nearby, all other enemies within range have their resistances reduced by -200%. This gives you a
          five second window of opportunity to damage Akarat.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          Defeat Akarat on Destruction difficulty to get <span class="unique">Visions of Akarat.</span> (1/250 chance of

        </p>
        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          Driven mad by nightmares, the Western aristocrat Lord Aldric Jitan hopes to summon a terrible demon and plunge
          the land into darkness. Stop him before he does.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Another encounter with immunity shields. Jitan comes with an army of 20 guardsmen, which need to be killed
          before you can harm Jitan. The enemies are tougher than before and will heal themselves, as well as summon
          guard towers that will pummel the living daylights out of you if you stand still for too long. Keep moving and
          the towers will vanish behind you.

          Also bring some resistances, because the enemies inflict fire, cold and lightning damage.

          When any enemy dies, a vortex of shadow spawns at the location of the deceased fighter. Do not run into it, or
          you will die instantly. Use a weapon with a long reach and keep your finger on the Shift key.

          Bartuc, the Warlord of Blood, was once Horazon's brother in the Vizjerei mage clan. Whereas Horazon wanted to
          summon demons to enslave them, Bartuc chose to worship them and traded his soul for demonic power. Their
          conflict eventually led to a civil war that shattered the mage clan. Although Bartuc was eventually destroyed
          by the very powers he sought to control, his soul and power have been claimed by the forces of Hell.<br><br>

          It may be possible to summon Bartuc's spirit in the crypt where his cursed armor was buried...
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Bartuc and his summoned Blood Golems have ranged attacks and can hurt a lot in this tiny room. Compounding the
          challenge is the fact that the Blood Golems are only vulnerable for a brief moment after hitting you, and
          Bartuc can only be harmed after he uses his Wychwind attack.<br><br>

          The enemies use physical attacks and they hit hard. The most dangerous attack is Bartuc's Wychwind, which can
          kill you on the spot if you run into the rift field. Attack him after he uses this ability, because it also
          removes his immunities. Bartuc also summons more Blood Golems.

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          When Uldyssian sacrificed his life at the Cathedral of Vanity in the battle between angels and demons, his
          soul was thought to be blown to the far reaches of the universe.<br><br>

          But a malicious spirit in the High Heavens, watching over the battle from afar, snatched Uldyssian and his
          edyrem on their way to oblivion. Imperius, archangel and high warlord of the Crystal Arch, had his own
          opinions about Sanctuary and the human vermin inhabiting it. This taint on Creation had to be
          eradicated.<br><br>

          But his side of the argument, despite the support of Malthael, lost out in the Angiris Council due to the
          intervention of Tyrael, and the ensuing blood pact with Mephisto prevented him from intervening on the mortal
          plane at all. A puppet had to be found, and Uldyssian was just what he sought. After a thorough brainwashing,
          Imperius sent his harbinger Dark Uldyssian to Sanctuary with the mission to exact divine justice and destroy
          the world...
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Dark Uldyssian and his Fallen Edyrem are ghosts that exist only partially on the mortal plane and cannot be
          hit by mortal weapons and spells.<br><br>

          The war machine has one weak spot. When the army runs into trouble, Dark Uldyssian will summon an Avatar of
          Imperius or Malthael to aid them. This avatar is vulnerable. Kill it to sever the link.<br><br>

          An avatar will be summoned 1% of the time when Dark Uldyssian hits a player or minion. The Fallen Edyrem do
          not have this power. You can recognise Dark Uldyssian by his heavy armour. What they all have in common is
          their Divine Apparition ability which warps them next to their victim with a freezing blast.<br><br>

          The Avatars bear the secrets of Creation and can throw alchemical nuclear bombs from Heaven. They also have
          the ability to cast lethal spiked death bolts. Lastly, they summon more Fallen Edyrem at a rapid rate.

        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          There are many religions in Sanctuary. Although they all tell very different stories, loremasters agree that
          since most of them seem to be effective and enable their faithful to work miracles, there has to be a common
          truth between them.<br><br>

          One particular element found in most religions is the creation of the world by a God or other deity, whether
          it be Zakarum, Inarius and Lilith or Trang-Oul or the Four Elements or even Kharos or Tiarna Dulra.<br><br>

          Some alchemical scientists even believe that the world as we know it was shaped by an individual human on
          another plane, one 'Brother Laz' with a calculation engine powered by lightning. According to this cult, when
          humanity complains too much about the difficult living conditions in Sanctuary and the scarcity of divine
          weaponry, he may send his avatar to the mortal plane to deal with those who annoy him in person...
        </p>

        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The Groupies are just your average frenzied mod fanatics with throwing knives and should not be too hard to
          dispatch.<br><br>

          The boss, Brother Laz is something else. Do not stand still in his crosshairs or he will cast either
          Deathstrike or Singularity on you and destroy you. If you keep moving, he will attempt an offensive teleport,
          summon more minions and may cast totems that kill you with Disintegrate if you go near them.<br><br>

          If you take down the totems, you will receive an unholy death curse that kills you when you next receive
          damage, so avoid doing this at all costs and give them a wide berth to avoid instant annihilation!<br><br>

          Brother Laz is invulnerable to any damage. Use the <i>Purify</i> skill you acquired in Duncraig and keep
          hitting him with it until he dies.

        </p>

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          In his vanity, fallen angel Inarius made the fatal mistake of raiding one of Mephisto's black temples on
          mortal soil and killing the dark monks there. The Prime Evils had previously ignored this rebellious angel,
          but this was an insult they could not leave unpunished. Mephisto invaded Inarius' cathedral of vanity, burned
          it to the ground and captured Inarius and his followers, warping and mutating them into flabby and horrible
          creatures - the Overlords - instilling them with eternal hatred for the still beautiful creations of Zakarum,
          humans.<br><br>

          You may be able to summon Inarius' ghost at a place of great significance for the fallen angel...
        </p>

        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          Even in their weakened state, Inarius' ghost and his minions hit very hard and almost always hit. This fight
          is most similar to the Butcher, but with multiple enemies.

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          This uberlevel is a recreation of the city of Kurast located at the Kehjistani frontier, 3000 years before the
          birth of the prophet Akarat and during the Mage Clan Wars between the Ennead, Annuit and Vizjerei clans.
          Kurast, a neutral town allied with the Taan, was seized by the Ennead and used as a necromantic military
          outpost. Can you destroy the magical fortifications and liberate the town?
        </p>
        <p><b>Enemies</b><br>
          The town is well defended by armies of skeletons undead. Around the town square you will find the Ennead
          shadowgate totems, which periodically raise additional skeletons and emit a magical field that grants
          invulnerability to nearby units. The necromantic army is tended to by a contingent of Ennead Necromancers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Bosses</b><br>
          Your targets are the Ennead Necromancers spread out around town. They summon more skeletons and cast the
          powerful Nightmare curse, slowing you down and disabling magical healing.
        </p>

          <i>'Your curiosity will be the death of you!'</i><br><br>

          Thousands of years ago, two religions competed with one another. The Cathedral of Light, founded by the angel
          Inarius. The Temple of the Triune, worshipping three self-proclaimed holy spirits - Mefis, Dialon and
          Bala.<br><br>

          The Island of the Sunless Sea, the place where angels watch, the staging ground of the angelic legions,
          changed hands many times. From the forces of the High Heavens to Baal and back and then to the Temple of the
          Triune and its leader, Primus, also known as Lucion, son of Mephisto.<br><br>

          You may encounter some tough opposition in the gloomy ice cave, but the stakes are high - taking out Lucion
          would remove him as a threat in the present day. Get to it, time traveller.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The regular monsters are almost tougher than the bosses on this level. Many foes are invisible, and all have
          high damage and chance to hit.<br><br>

          Be wary of Malic’s Messenger at the entrance gate. The familiar is not dangerous on its own, but explodes on
          death, creating a shockwave that pushes you back, possibly into unexplored territory.<br><br>

          Malic is a priest with a powerful rain of fire and a homing Punisher spell. This slow moving doom bolt usually
          leaves you poisoned at 1 life. Avoid it.<br><br>

          Lucion emits an unholy invulnerability aura that makes nearby enemies immortal. Try to separate him from his
          minions or kill him first. He also has a lethal poisonous melee attack.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          Defeat Malic on Destruction difficulty to get the <span class="unique">Six Angel Bag.</span>

          Heaven. Nirvana. Celestia. Call it what you will. Home of the angelic legions, who almost destroyed the taint
          on Creation that is the mortal plane twice and allowed it to get overrun by the forces of Hell. Far from being
          the beings of love they are believed to be by the common folk, the angels of the High Heavens present a clear
          and present danger to Sanctuary. It may be better to strike first.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The Ethereals are the physical manifestations of common angels. They attack furiously, but when you kill one
          of them, it shatters, weakening other nearby enemies. This does however enrage them and they will swarm you at
          the speed of a lightning bolt.<br><br>

          The untargetable Lightwells cast Punisher spells at you at a rapid rate. Try to avoid them, because a direct
          hit deals incredible amounts of poison damage. Their location changes from game to game.<br><br>

          The main targets to take out are Zakarum’s Avatars watching over the battle. You can only attack Zakarum's
          Avatars when their resistances are lowered.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward</b><br>
          Defeat Zakarum's Avatars on Destruction difficulty to get the <span class="unique">Zakarum's Ear</span> (1/12

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          The capital of the Amazon nation, Tran Athulua, is almost impossible to take by land or sea. After a
          humiliating defeat at the hands of the Amazon defenders, a band of pirates hired you to assassinate the
          Priestesses and steal their expensive shinies.<br><br>

          The uberlevel features amazon archers and three Priestesses, devoted to each of the three elemental gods.
          Philios serves Hefaetrus, god of fire. Skovos serves Karcheus, god of ice. Lycander serves Zerae, goddess of
          vengeance and storms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The common Amazons deal lots of damage, so keep moving to avoid Guided Chain. Otherwise the arrows will keep
          returning and doing damage many times over.<br><br>

          The Priestesses are very hard due to their Phalanx and Tremor spells. Phalanx can be dodged by staying at the
          northwest or southeast of the Priestess; this prevents the Phalanx archers from lining up and whacking you
          with 20 arrows per second. There is no way to mitigate Tremor damage, because it is percentage based. You can
          easily recognise the Priestess in a large pack by her heavy armour.

          After the destruction of the Worldstone, a new era of peace and prosperity began, eventually evolving into
          what we call the modern age. Humanity has all but forgotten how to deal with demons. Until out of nowhere an
          evil force beneath the metropolis of Fauztinville begins to corrupt the machinery and pets, turning them
          against their masters. Overwhelmed by the assault, the army employs its new experimental time machine to
          request help from the heroes of the past. Will you answer the call?<br>

          Once a humble settlement founded by the mage Fauztin, the city has grown to over ten million inhabitants after
          the destruction of the Worldstone. All have died or left the city in the face of an onslaught of demonically
          twisted robots and demons bursting from the city's neon signs.<br>

          The invasion is led by five warped robots, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon. These are your targets.
          Terminate them.
        </p>
        <p><b>Enemies</b><br>
          Fauztinville has fallen under an onslaught of demonically twisted robots and demons bursting from the city's
          neon signs. Each battle should be straightforward, but beware their various immunities, notably the
          tri-elemental immunities of Neon Fiends. Summoners should eliminate Harpylisks first to prevent their bouncing
          blade attack from ravaging their forces.
        </p>
        <p><b>Bosses</b><br>
          The invasion is led by five warped robots, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon. Find them in the back alleys
          of Fauztinville and terminate them. If you have trouble finding them, look for dead-end streets and hidden
          passages through buildings. One of the five requires a teleport skill to access; if you do not have a
          teleportation spell, use an item with charges of Blink or Jitan’s Gate, like the runeword Pax Mystica or the
          reward charm for the Lord Aldric Jitan uberquest.

          You ended the demon invasion of Fauztinville... fast forward another few thousand years. Following a global
          demon apocalypse, the city is in ruins. Lilith, once banished to the Plane of the Dead, broke free and worse
          still, corrupted the sons of the cosmic dragon Trang-Oul.<br><br>

          The draconic death god is the ruler of the Plane of the Dead. Weakened by his battle against the angelic and
          demonic legions at the end of time in the far future, Trang-Oul was unable to stop Lilith from capturing and
          possessing his drakes.<br><br>

          The shadowy Dark Star Dragons were unleashed upon Sanctuary by Lilith’s forces. There is no hope for
          humanity’s resistance forces unless these creatures are eliminated. The old time machine was put into action
          once again... Will you help out Fauztinville a second time?
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          The Howling Spirits materialise directly on top of you when you approach their hiding spots. You have no
          choice but to take some hits unless you have inhuman reflexes. Defence is very important.<br><br>

          The Dark Star Dragon on the level has a dual rotating energy beam attack that slays anyone it touches. Use the
          ruins and debris to avoid the beam. He also summons more Howling Spirits when threatened. You will need to
          deliver as much damage as fast as possible, because the Dark Star Dragon has a very fast regeneration ability.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward (requires your class charm)</b><br>
          Bring the appropriate class charm you found in Kurast 3000 BA. Defeat the Dark Star Dragon on Destruction
          difficulty within 3 minutes after entering the level and without dying. If you succeed, a single use cube
          recipe is available to upgrade your class charm. You only have 30 seconds after killing the Dark Star Dragon
          to use the recipe.

          The radiant city of Ureh, thought to be a gateway to Heaven in ancient times. As it turned out, Diablo had
          taken the form of an angel and deceived the city wizards, tricking them into casting a spell that doomed the
          city.<br><br>

          Ureh and everyone within are now trapped between the mortal plane and Hell, appearing in this world only once
          every two thousand years, when the shadow of Mount Nymyr falls upon the ruins.<br><br>

          Be there.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategy</b><br>
          This is zombie city. Worse, this is immortal zombie city. Do not bother attacking the ghost citizens, because
          you cannot. Keep moving at all costs to avoid the undead hordes.<br><br>

          This is a huge level, there is no minimap, the lighting is very dim and the boss is located in a distant
          corner. Please run around like a damsel in a zombie film until you find the narrow bridge leading to King
          Juris Khan.<br><br>

          Raw firepower is almost useless in this level, because very few enemies can be killed at all. Do equip all the
          run speed and hit recovery bonuses you can get, try to get some minions and a teleportation spell, either
          natively or granted by an item.<br><br>

          The most dangerous part is the narrow ledge leading to King Juris Khan. Do your best to get a teleportation
          ability. If your class cannot teleport, get a source of Blink or Jitan’s Gate. Blink can be found on the
          runeword staff Pax Mystica, Jitan’s Gate appears on the Lord Aldric Jitan uberquest reward.<br><br>

          Skills that allow you to move past enemies, such as Angel of Death or Spin to Win can be very useful here...

        <p class="uberDesc"><b>Lore</b><br>
          The powerful demonlord Assur is on the move, burning a wake of destruction across the Western Kingdoms and
          turning the inhabitants of the towns he razes into mindless minions on his side. All efforts to stop him so
          far have failed thanks to Assur's powerful invulnerability rune. Find a way to kill him before he takes over
          the world.</p>
        <p><b>Enemies</b><br>
          There are several variants of the common Lost Soul enemies. Most are mindless zombies with a very strong melee
          claw or blade attack. Most.<br><br>

          Some of them, however, rush at you with lit powder barrels! They can throw the barrels over great distances,
          then light the fuse. When the flame reaches the barrel, a very big explosion follows. Run away from the barrel
          when you see the burning fuse approaching. The explosion will instantly kill even the most powerful
          character.<br><br>

          Others throw hexed bone shards that explode on the ground, emitting lethal poison clouds. This is powerful
          enough to kill anyone, but being undead, their aim may be off, allowing you to get out of the way. You should
          get some Maximum Poison Resist to survive their attack!
        </p>
        <p><b>Bosses</b><br>
          Assur wields powerful fire magic and pierces 200% of your fire resistance, but his main threat is the
          invulnerability shield. It is impossible to damage Assur directly. You will have to wrestle the secret to
          destroy Assur from his henchmen.</p>
        <p><b>The Secret</b><br>
          Retrieve the five demon seals from Assur's lieutenants: Skinrender, Spinecracker, Eyegouger, Fleshcutter and
          Bonehexer. On Destruction difficulty, each lieutenant drops his own seal. When you have the five Seals, kill
          Slain Souls until a <span class="unique">Ring of the Five</span> drops. Cube it with all five seals to create
          <span class="unique">Assur's Bane</span>.
          Go back to Assur, then select your ring's Purify spell. This spell bypasses Assur's invulnerability and will
          take him out in a few hits.
        </p>
        <p><b>An important note about Purify</b><br>
          Purify works best in combination with the Open Wounds attribute. Purify triggers the damage from Open Wounds,
          and if you keep applying Open Wounds on a monster while it's taking damage, it will keep bleeding and losing
          life.</p>
